# MNIST_DNN_Part1
This repository contains the implementation of a deep neural network (DNN) for handwritten digit recognition, developed from scratch in C++. The project is part of an academic assignment that demonstrates the design and training of a vanilla DNN to classify digits from the MNIST dataset without the use of any external machine learning libraries.
